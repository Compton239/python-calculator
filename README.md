Fun Calculator
Overview
The Fun Calculator is a simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two user-provided numbers. It calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the inputs, making it a great tool for quick calculations with a playful twist! üéâ
Features

Accepts two numbers (including decimals) from the user.
Performs four arithmetic operations:
Addition (‚ûï)
Subtraction (‚ûñ)
Multiplication (‚úñÔ∏è)
Division (‚ûó)


Displays results in a clear, user-friendly format.
Written in Python, making it easy to understand and modify.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
No external libraries are required.
How to Use
Run the Program:
Save the Python script (e.g., fun_calculator.py) to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.
Run the script using:python fun_calculator.py




Input Numbers:
When prompted, enter the first number.
Enter the second number.
Both inputs can be integers or decimals (e.g., 3.14).


View Results:
The program will display the results of the four arithmetic operations (sum, difference, product, and quotient).
Example Output
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 15.0
Difference: 5.0
Product: 50.0
Quotient: 2.0

Notes

Division by Zero: The current version assumes the second number is not zero. For production use, consider adding error handling to manage division-by-zero cases.
The program uses float() to allow decimal inputs, ensuring flexibility for various calculations.
Feel free to extend the program by adding more operations (e.g., exponentiation) or input validation!
